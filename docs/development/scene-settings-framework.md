# Scene Settings Framework

Catalog-backed system that overrides feature settings by **interior**, **time of day**, **weather**, and
**location**, blending between them as the game state changes.

**Provenance:** ported from `Dlizzio/open-shaders` branch `feat/scene-manager` (upstream range
`06eaa584a..1119234f9`), squashed into `feat(scene-manager): port scene settings framework`, then
re-synced against upstream **rev4** (location regions replacing rev3's categories, instant apply across a
loading screen, apply verification, the cached apply document; rev3 brought location transitions, resolver
caching and the generic scene copy API). The port is **backend only**: upstream's authoring UI was never taken, and
Community Shaders branding was kept throughout. This fork grows its own editor in `src/CSEditor/`. See
[What was dropped](#what-was-dropped) and [Known gaps](#known-gaps) before assuming a missing piece is a
bug.

**On-disk compatibility with upstream is a hard requirement:** a `SceneManager.json` authored in
open-shaders must load in Community Shaders with every setting honored, and vice versa. Any divergence
below is behavioral, never a change to the file format.

## Files

Everything belonging to the system lives under `src/CSEditor/SceneManager/`.

| File | Role |
| ---- | ---- |
| `SceneSettingsManager.h` | The public interface: storage, persistence, resolver, apply/restore, blending. |
| `SceneSettingsPolicy.h` | Hand-maintained allow/deny lists consumed by the manager. |
| `SceneManager.{h,cpp}` | The `Feature` that *is* the manager: it inherits `SceneSettingsManager`, forwards the lifecycle hooks and draws the debug view. |
| `cmake/generate_scene_settings_catalog.py` | Build-time generator; parses `src/**/*.{h,hpp,cpp,cxx}`. |
| `features/Scene Manager/` | `CORE` marker + `SceneManager.ini` (version `1-0-0`). |
| `tests/test_scene_settings_catalog_generator.py` | Generator unit tests (hermetic + catalog assertions). |
| `tests/test_scene_settings_policy.py` | Checks the policy lists against the real catalog. |

Generated into `${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/generated` (e.g. `build/ALL/generated`), never committed:

-   `SceneSettingsCatalog.generated.h` / `.cpp` — the `SceneSettingsCatalog` namespace and the catalog array.
-   `FeatureSceneSettingsAdapters.generated.cpp` — per-feature control resolvers (see
    [Known gaps](#known-gaps)).

### How the manager is split

`SceneSettingsManager` is one class declared in one header, but its members are defined across several
translation units so no single file stays unreadable. Find a member by what it does, not by file name:

| TU | Holds |
| -- | ----- |
| `SceneSettingsManager.cpp` | Singleton (the constructor registers `this`, so it is `globals::features::sceneManager`), lifecycle, `Update()`, name/path resolution. |
| `SceneSettingsResolve.cpp` | `ResolveAndApply()` and the apply/restore pipeline. |
| `SceneSettingsSerialization.cpp` | `SceneManager.json` load and save. |
| `SceneSettingsDiscovery.cpp` | Overwrite-file scanning and preset baking. |
| `SceneSettingsContext.cpp` | Context add / update / remove. |
| `SceneSettingsCopy.cpp` | The [generic copy API](#generic-scene-copy-api). |
| `SceneSettingsWeather.cpp` / `SceneSettingsLocation.cpp` | The weather and location layers. |
| `SceneSettingsDebug.cpp` | The resolver-state debug view. |

Helpers that more than one of those needs are not file-local. They live in four internal namespaces with
their own headers, and every consumer opens them with a file-scope `using namespace`:

-   `SceneSettingsInternal` — catalog lookup, JSON path walking, policy evaluation, entry validation.
-   `SceneSettingsOverwrites` — the overwrite directory layout and the grouped JSON files in it.
-   `SceneSettingsLocationTargets` — the broadest-to-narrowest location target chain.
-   `SceneSettingsContextRules` — which layer a context writes to and how its entries group.

A helper only one TU uses stays in that TU's anonymous namespace. Promote it to an internal namespace
when, and only when, a second TU needs it.

## How the catalog is built

`CMakeLists.txt` runs the generator as a custom command before compiling, with
`--min-entries 645 --min-controllable 538 --min-controllable-features 30` as a regression gate. The two
controllable floors are the ones that matter: a parser change that stops binding a control does not
remove the entry, it silently drops its `SceneControllable` flag. Keep them just under the real numbers.
It statically parses feature sources and derives, for every persisted setting:

-   the serialized address (`serializedPath` / `serializedKey` / `serializedComponent`) used to reach the
    value inside a feature's settings JSON
-   the display address (`displayPath`, `selectorPath`) reconstructed from `DrawSettings()` brace scopes and
    tab helpers
-   the editor semantic (`Toggle` / `Numeric` / `Choice` / `Text` / `Generic`), numeric bounds, display scale,
    `Log2` transforms, and combo choice values, read from the actual ImGui call
-   i18n keys from the `T(TKEY(...), "...")` call wrapping the control
-   flags: `Persisted`, `Transitionable`, `Hidden`, `BooleanControl`, `SceneControllable`

`validate_entries()` fails the build on duplicates, contradictory visibility, choices with fewer than two
distinct values, `Log2` bounds that include zero, and incomplete aggregates (a vector exposing only some
components).

This makes the framework **feature-agnostic**: a feature exposes scene-controllable settings simply by
persisting them and drawing them with a recognized ImGui call. There is no registration API and no
per-feature code to write. This is what replaced the deleted `WeatherVariableRegistry`.

Current catalog on this fork: **660 entries**, 551 of them scene-controllable across 30 features.

A non-primitive member persisted under its own JSON key fails the build unless its type is listed in
`UNCATALOGED_PERSISTED_AGGREGATE_TYPES`. Generic type names are qualified there (`PostProcessing::Settings`,
the tonemap ownership switch persisted as `ppsettings`), so another feature's `Settings` still trips the guard.

## Runtime flow

1.  **Boot** — `SceneManager::SetupResources()` calls `LoadAll()` (overwrites + user settings for
    non-weather scene types). `globals::sceneSettingsManager` is wired in `globals::OnInit()`.
2.  **Data loaded** — `SceneManager::DataLoaded()` calls `OnDataLoaded()` (weather/location data needs
    `TESDataHandler` for SPID resolution) and registers `MenuOpenCloseEventHandler`, which flags a cell
    transition when the loading menu closes.
3.  **Per frame** — `State::Draw()` calls `SceneManager::Update()` → `SceneSettingsManager::Update()` →
    `ResolveAndApply()`. The resolver early-outs unless something it depends on moved: interior flag,
    location/cell FormID, game hour (`kHourUpdateThreshold`), or weather pair + lerp.

### How values are applied

There is no per-setting writer and no pointer patching. `ApplyCatalogSceneSettings()`:

1.  take the feature's `featureApplyDocuments` entry, seeding it from `feature.SaveSettings(json)` on first use
2.  resolve every catalog address up front and reject the whole batch on a type mismatch, before mutating
3.  overwrite the primitives, clamping each into its control's range (see [Numeric bounds](#numeric-bounds))
4.  `feature.LoadSettings(json)` to push the whole block back
5.  on exception, roll the originals back into the document and reload it

The document is **kept between applies**, so a per-frame location transition costs no `SaveSettings` and no
full copy. That is also why validation precedes mutation: a rejected update must leave nothing behind. If
even the rollback throws, the cached document is dropped so the next apply re-snapshots.

`baselineSettings` holds the pre-override value so a setting that leaves scope is restored rather than left
stuck. Failed applies back off (`kApplyRetryDelay`, 2s) and log once per signature instead of every frame.

**An accepted apply is verified.** A feature that silently clamps or discards what it was handed still
reports success, so `ScheduleApplyVerification()` records the batch and `VerifyPendingApplies()` reads it
back the following frame. A feature that did not retain the values loses its applied entries and its cached
document, and backs off like an outright failure.

**Consequence:** a feature's `SaveSettings`/`LoadSettings` pair is the contract. A setting that is not
round-trippable through them cannot be scene-controlled, no matter what its UI looks like.

### Numeric bounds

Applying a value goes JSON patch → `LoadSettings` → shader constants, which never runs the ImGui call that
would otherwise bound it. Every in-app path already produces in-range values (the interceptor replays the
feature's own clamping widget, blending lerps between two valid endpoints, a copy moves a value that was
valid at its source), so the exposure is the on-disk contract: `IsSceneSettingValueAllowed` gates the
*type* of a value, not its range, and a hand-edited or foreign `SceneManager.json` can carry anything.

`ClampCatalogNumericValue()` closes that in `ApplyCatalogSceneSettings()`, the one place any scene value
reaches a feature. It covers `EditorSemantic::Numeric` entries carrying `hasNumericBounds` (416 of the
current catalog's 660). Bounds are authored in **display** space, so the range is converted once through
`ConvertCatalogNumericDisplayToStored()` rather than round-tripping every value; both transforms are
monotonic, so the min stays the min. An integer-typed value clamps to the whole numbers inside the range,
since an integer control cannot land on a fractional bound.

**Only the applied copy is clamped.** The scene entry keeps the value it was authored with, so a document
written by another implementation survives the round trip, the same intent-preserving trade the
[location transitions](#location-transitions) make with `retainSerializedTransition`. A clamp is reported
once per address (`WarnOnceAboutClampedSceneSetting`), because an out-of-range entry re-applies every frame
its scene is active.

**Restores are never clamped.** `CatalogSceneSettingUpdate::clampToControlRange` travels per update rather
than per call, because the resolver batches scene values and baseline restores into one apply. A baseline is
the feature's own pre-override value; clamping it would rewrite user data that was already live before the
scene layer engaged. The flag is `!update.restore` in the resolver, `!transition.restoreAtEnd` for a
location transition, and `false` in `RestoreAppliedSettings()`.

### Precedence and blending

`BuildResolvedSettings()` overlays in order, later winning per setting address:

```
interior  →  time of day  →  weather  →  location (worldspace → location type → region → location → cell)
```

Within a layer, `EntrySource::Overwrite` (mod-shipped files) is overlaid first and `EntrySource::User`
overrides it, so a shipped overwrite acts as that layer's default and the user's own entry for the same
address always wins. `SettingsUser.json` remains the baseline beneath all of this.

-   **Time of day** — six periods (`Dawn`, `Sunrise`, `Day`, `Sunset`, `Dusk`, `Night`) whose starts come
    from the active climate's sky colour windows (`GetPeriodStartHours`): Dawn when the sky leaves night
    colours, Sunrise at the sunrise colour peak, Day when fully day, Sunset when the sky leaves day, Dusk at
    the sunset colour peak, Night when fully night again. Without a valid climate, `kFallbackPeriodStartHours` (vanilla
    `SkyrimClimate`) applies. Floats cross-fade over `timeOfDayTransitionHours`: blends out of night or
    day start at the boundary, blends into day or night finish at it, and blends at the colour peaks are
    centred, so every blend stays inside the sky's own transition. The blend is capped so each period fits
    one. Non-float settings snap.
-   **Weather**: floats blend across `Sky::currentWeatherPct` between the outgoing and incoming weather.
-   **Location**: see [Location targets](#location-targets); the chain resolves broadest to narrowest, so a
    cell entry wins over the location that contains it, which wins over the region that contains them both.
-   **Saved sets.** A weather or location (`PeriodicSceneConfig`) keeps two sets side by side: a flat set
    (entries with `period == Count`) and a per-period set. `timeOfDayEnabled` picks which one resolves
    (`IsPeriodActive`); the other is kept untouched, so switching back restores it. The mode comes from the
    user's choice, else a shipped overwrite's `timeOfDayEnabled` metadata, else per-period only when every
    entry is. Any user edit pins the current mode so a later preset cannot move the user's entries between
    sets. A per-period location set keeps the location whitelist but takes only transitionable floats,
    blended across periods.
-   Writes smaller than `kBlendEpsilon` (1e-3) are skipped so blending does not spam `LoadSettings`.

**Divergence from upstream, deliberate:** upstream overlays `User` first and `Overwrite` second, so a
mod-shipped overwrite wins over the user's own entry for the same address. This fork inverts the order
everywhere (`OverlayAllEntries`, `CollectPeriodValueGroups`, `BuildEffectiveContextEntries`) so the user
wins. Both read the same files; only the winner differs. Preserve the inversion in any new overlay code.

### Location targets

A location resolves to a **chain** of targets, broadest first, built by `BuildLocationTargetChain()`:

| `LocationTargetType` | Source | Notes |
| -------------------- | ------ | ----- |
| `Worldspace` | The `TESWorldSpace` of an **exterior** cell | Interiors contribute none. |
| `LocationType` | `LocType*` keywords on the **innermost** location | Deduplicated and sorted by form key, so the chain is stable. |
| `Region` | The `TESRegion` covering an **exterior** cell | `Sky::region` when the player is in that cell, since it knows which of the overlapping regions won; otherwise the cell's first non-null `GetRegionList()` entry. Interiors contribute no region. |
| `Location` | The `BGSLocation` chain, walked through `parentLoc` and reversed | Cycle-guarded by a visited FormID set. |
| `Cell` | The player's parent cell | Its `editorId` is the coc code. |

`GetCurrentLocationTargets()` caches the player's chain by location + cell + region FormID; the region is
part of the key because overlapping regions can change winner without the cell changing.
`ResolveLocationTargetChain(type, formKey)` answers the same question for an **arbitrary** target: it
reuses the player's chain when the target is in it, otherwise it looks the form up through
`Util::ParseSpid` / `Util::SpidToFormId` and rebuilds. A region is reached through the cells it covers, so
off-chain it resolves to a chain of itself.

The editor offers two ways to add a target: the live chain table, so every link the player is standing in
is one click away, and a searchable picker over `BuildLocationCatalog()` for any place the game defines.

Persisted under `location.worldspaces` / `location.locationTypes` / `location.regions` /
`location.locations` / `location.cells` in `SceneManager.json` and under `Locations/<form key>/` for
overwrites. The earlier open-shaders `categories` section (type `Category`) is read and migrated to
`locationTypes`.

### Location transitions

Location float overrides ease in and out instead of snapping, because crossing a cell boundary otherwise
pops every affected setting.

-   Duration comes from the entry's own `transitionSeconds`, falling back to the global
    `location.transitionSeconds` (`kDefaultLocationTransitionSeconds` = 5s, clamped to
    `kMaxLocationTransitionSeconds` = 300s).
-   Time comes from `globals::state->timer`, so transitions freeze with the game rather than the wall clock.
-   Easing is smoothstep (`t * t * (3 - 2t)`). `StartLocationTransitions()` retargets from the **live** eased
    value, so reversing direction mid-transition never snaps.
-   Only **walking** between exterior cells of one worldspace animates (`walkedBetweenWorldspaceCells`).
    Editing a value in place snaps to it, and so does arriving from a loading screen: `OnLoadingTransition()`
    resolves with `allowLocationTransitions = false` so the destination's values are already in place when
    the player sees it. `locationOverridesDirty` alone just reconciles the targets.
-   In-flight transitions are grouped into per-feature `LocationTransitionBatch`es so one `LoadSettings` call
    covers every animating setting of a feature. A failing batch logs once and backs off by signature.
-   `RestoreAppliedSettings()` clears all transitions first, so tearing the scene layer down cannot leave a
    half-eased value applied.

A duration set on one component of an aggregate control (a colour, a vector) applies to the whole control:
`SetLocationEntryTransitionSeconds()` expands the selection through `GetCopyGroupKey()` before validating.

**Durations are edited from the scene editor.** The global duration is a typed field in the location
page's toolbar (`ScenePageToolbar`), shown only for `SceneContextType::Location`. The per-entry
override is the third slot of each control's gutter (`SceneWidgetBinding::Guard::DrawTransitionSlot`),
shown only when the page is a location page and every catalog component the control covers carries
`SettingFlag::Transitionable`, the same predicate `FindAllowedCatalogSetting` applies when loading a
document. A gutter field left empty inherits the global; a row with no override yet shows the
inherited value inert.

Typed values are clamped to `0..kMaxLocationTransitionSeconds`, whereas a value loaded from a
document that falls outside that range is still rejected and flagged `retainSerializedTransition`.
The divergence is deliberate: a human typing sees the correction happen, while a document authored by
another implementation has an intent worth preserving through the round trip.

### Resolver caching

The resolver runs every frame, so everything it can precompute is cached and invalidated by revision
counter rather than rebuilt:

| Cache | Invalidated by | Holds |
| ----- | -------------- | ----- |
| `timeOfDayValueGroups`, `weatherValueGroups` | `sceneValueRevision` | Per-address `std::array<std::optional<float>, kPeriodCount>` period values, so blending never re-walks the entry lists. |
| `featureBaseSnapshots` | `InvalidateFeatureSnapshot()` | A feature's settings JSON with the scene layer folded back out, used as the baseline source. |
| `configuredFeatureNamesCache` | `configuredFeatureNamesRevision` | Which features have any scene entry at all. |
| `cachedLocationOverrides` | `locationOverridesDirty` | The resolved location layer, rebuilt only when the target chain or an entry moved. |
| `resolvedSettingsScratch` | reused every resolve | The resolved map itself, so the per-frame path does not reallocate. |
| `cachedLocationTargets` | location/cell/region FormID change | The player's target chain. |
| `featureApplyDocuments` | `InvalidateFeatureSnapshot()` | The settings JSON each apply mutates in place, so a transition frame never re-serializes the feature. |

**Divergence from upstream, deliberate:** upstream bumps `sceneValueRevision` at ~22 call sites and sets
`locationOverridesDirty` at ~9. This fork funnels both through `MarkSceneValuesDirty()`, called from
`BumpEntryPresentationRevision()` and `ReapplyIfActive()`. That is a strict superset of upstream's
invalidation; the cost is at most one extra period-map rebuild per user action, never per frame. Route new
mutations through those two functions instead of touching the counters directly.

Apply failures are keyed by a `size_t` signature (`CombineHash` / `HashSceneSettingValue`) so a retry is
skipped until the pending values actually change.

### SceneLayerGuard

`SceneSettingsManager::SceneLayerGuard` is an RAII suspend of the scene layer. Anything that reads or writes
a feature's *base* settings must hold one, otherwise it captures an overridden value as if it were the user's
choice. It is default-constructed (`SceneLayerGuard guard;`) and no-ops when the manager singleton does not
exist yet. Current holders: `State::Load`, `State::SaveToJson` and `State::LoadFromJson`, one internal manager
path (`GetFeatureSettingValue`), the two settings reads in the `FeatureOverwritesPanel` export dialog, and six
DevBench bridge endpoints. Add one to any new code path that serializes feature settings.
`SceneFeatureReplica` deliberately holds none: a scene page must show the live, scene-applied values.

In `State::SaveToJson` / `State::LoadFromJson` the guard is declared **before** `m_mutex` is taken, so the
resolve it triggers on destruction does not run while the lock is held.

## Generic Scene Copy API

Copies settings between any two scene contexts (a time-of-day period, the interior scene, or one saved set
of a weather or location target). Driven by `ScenePageToolbar`, which puts the From/To submenus on every
scene page. Only a scene's active set is offered: its flat set, or one entry per period when time of day
is on.

A context is a `SceneContextId`: a `SceneContextType` plus whichever of `period` / `weatherId` /
`locationType` + `locationFormKey` that type uses. `IsValidSceneContext()` rejects any mixed combination,
so a malformed context can never reach the mutation path.

| Method | Const | Purpose |
| ------ | ----- | ------- |
| `GetCopySources(destination)` | yes | Every context that holds something usable, with a localized label and a compatible-setting count. Excludes the destination itself. Sorted by type, then label. |
| `GetCopyDestinations(source)` | yes | Every context the source can copy into, including pages with nothing authored yet. |
| `GetCopyCandidates(source, destination)` | yes | Per-setting preview: display name, value, `compatible`, `conflicts`. Drives the confirmation dialog. |
| `CopySettings(source, destination, conflictPolicy)` | no | Performs the copy and returns a `CopyResult` (`copied` / `skipped` / `overwritten` / `incompatible` / `hadConflicts` / `cancelled`). |

A copy always takes the whole source context. The per-setting variant upstream carries (`CopyScope::Setting`
plus a `SettingIdentity`) was removed: this fork's toolbar is page-scoped, and a single setting is moved by
editing it on the destination page instead.

**Compatibility.** A setting is copyable when it is in the catalog, allowed for the destination's scene
type, its value passes `IsSceneSettingValueAllowed`, and the destination has no active `Overwrite` shadowing
it. Only the location layer accepts non-float settings; every other destination requires numerics.
Compatibility is **group-aware**: members of one logical control (a colour, a vector) share a
`CopyGroupKey`, and one unusable member disqualifies the whole group, so a copy can never leave half a
colour behind.

**Conflicts** are compatible settings the destination already holds as a `User` entry.
`CopyConflictPolicy::SkipExisting` leaves the whole conflicting group alone, `OverwriteExisting` replaces
the value in place (keeping the existing `originalValue`), and `Cancel` aborts the entire operation and
returns `cancelled` without touching anything.

**`Cancel` is kept without a caller, and deliberately so.** The toolbar aborts a copy by dismissing the
preview before anything is staged, not by passing `CopyConflictPolicy::Cancel`: `StartCopy` builds the
candidate list for the same pair of contexts the copy will use, so the modal already shows every conflict,
and dismissing it is the same observable outcome for less noise (routing the button through the policy
would fire a "0 copied, 0 overwritten" toast for an action the user just cancelled). `Cancel` stays so a
future non-interactive caller can still ask for all-or-nothing.

**Transactionality.** Everything is validated and staged into a pending list first; the destination config
is only materialized once the copy is known to produce entries, and one `CommitSceneSettingChanges()` at the
end does a single save plus a single reapply.

**New entries get a correct `originalValue`** so revert and restore still work: from the destination's lower
layers for a location, from the time-of-day layer for a weather period, and from the feature baseline
otherwise. Copying into a location also carries a transition duration: the destination entry's own duration
wins, otherwise the source's.

## On-disk layout

Rooted at `Util::PathHelpers::GetSceneSettingsPath()` = `<CommunityShaders>/SceneSettings`.

| Path | Contents |
| ---- | ---- |
| `SceneManager.json` | All user-authored entries (interior, TOD, weather, location) in one document. |
| `InteriorOnly/`, `TimeOfDay/<Period>/` | Mod-shipped overwrite files per scene type. |
| `Weather/<SPID>/` | Per-weather overwrites, folder keyed by `Util::FormIdToSpid`. |
| `Locations/<form key>/` | Every location target type shares one tree; the target's type comes from its form. |

A weather or location folder holds its flat set directly and its per-period set in `<Period>/` subfolders
(`ForEachOverwriteSetDir`). The saved mode is written as `timeOfDayEnabled`; the older view-only
`showTimeOfDay` flag is read once and migrated only when it was `true`.

`SceneManager.json` is written atomically. If the existing document is present but not a JSON object, saves
are **blocked** rather than clobbering it, and unknown fields on an entry are preserved through
`serializedTemplate` for forward compatibility.

## Policy

`src/CSEditor/SceneManager/SceneSettingsPolicy.h` is hand-maintained and pruned to features that exist in this fork:

-   `kSettingBlacklist` — settings that must never be scene-overridden, matched by catalog address prefix;
    a bare feature name excludes the whole feature. Upstream's entries all pointed at features this fork
    does not have, so the list is this fork's own:
    -   the `ExponentialHeightFog` volumetric entries, which shape the froxel grid and its history buffers.
        Scene overrides travel through `SaveSettings` → JSON patch → `LoadSettings`, which never re-runs the
        allocation those settings size, so blending them mid-frame is not something the feature can honor.
    -   `ImageBasedLighting`'s `DisableInWorldMap` and `DisableInLoadingScreen`.
    -   all of `GrassOptimizations`, `TerrainVariation` and `VolumetricLighting`.
    -   upstream's `PostProcessing` entries, kept identical for on-disk compatibility: all of `Border` and
        `LUT` (`LUT::LoadSettings` rereads its texture from disk), DoF `HighlightShape`, Motion Blur
        `VelocityScale`, and the Color Grading tonemapper selection (`enableTonemap`, `useOpenDrt`,
        `currentTonemapper`, `tonemapParams`), which recompiles shaders.
-   `kLocationFeatureWhitelist` (6) and `kTimeOfDayFeatureWhitelist` (10): which features those scene types
    may target.

`PostProcessing` defers its load: `LoadSettings` stores the JSON and `ProcessSettings` applies it in
`Prepass`. Its per-load path must stay cheap because a blend reloads every frame, so sub-features reconcile
settings-sized resources in `Draw` and Color Grading recompiles only when the tonemapper changes.

When adding a feature to a whitelist, run `tests/test_scene_settings_policy.py`; it fails if a name is not
discovered in the generated catalog.

## Feature-facing contract

`Feature` gained two virtuals in this port (`src/Feature.h`):

| Virtual | Default | Meaning |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| `IsAlwaysEnabled()` | `false` | Infrastructure that cannot be disabled at boot. `State` erases it from `disabledFeatures` and refuses toggles. |
| `UsesMainSettings()` | `true` | Persists through the shared settings JSON; gates override discovery. |

`Feature::RegisterWeatherVariables()` was **removed**. Features no longer register anything; they just draw
plain ImGui controls over persisted members.

## What was dropped

Everything below exists upstream and was intentionally left out. Do not treat it as missing work unless
someone asks for the UI layer.

### Excluded upstream files

| File | Lines | What it was |
| ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| upstream `SceneSettingsUI.{h,cpp}` | ~3180 | The authoring UI: add-setting dialogs, per-scene panels, weather scene panel. This fork's `src/CSEditor/SceneManager/SceneSettingsUI.{h,cpp}` is unrelated in-house work that happens to share the name. |
| `src/SceneSettingsUIHooks.{h,cpp}` | ~776 | ImGui interception marking scene-controlled widgets and offering right-click capture. |
| `src/Features/SceneManagerUI.{h,cpp}` | ~34 | `SceneManager::DrawSettings()` body. |

Correspondingly, `SceneManager` here has **no** `PostPostLoad()` (upstream's called
`SceneSettingsUIHooks::Install()`), and its `DrawSettings()` is a debug view of the resolver's live state
rather than an authoring panel.

### Removed from this fork

-   `src/WeatherManager.{h,cpp}`, `src/WeatherVariableRegistry.h` and `docs/weather-system-docs/` — the old
    registry the catalog replaces.
-   `Util::WeatherUI::{IsWeatherControlled,SliderFloat,Checkbox,ColorEdit3,ColorEdit4}` — its only call sites
    were in `ExponentialHeightFog` (22) and `IBL` (7), and both are now plain `ImGui::` calls.
-   `src/CSEditor/InteriorOnlyPanel.{h,cpp}` and its EditorWindow category. `EditorWindow::LoadSettings()`
    remaps a saved `"Interior Only"` category to `"Weather"`.
-   The WeatherWidget per-feature "Features" tab and its `featureSettings` map (upstream replaced it with a
    "Scene Settings" tab that lives in the excluded UI), plus `OpenWeatherFeatureSetting()`.
-   The "Pause Weather Overrides" checkbox in `FeatureListRenderer`.
-   `SupportsVR()` on `SceneManager` — that virtual is an `alandtse` lineage concept and does not exist on
    this fork's `Feature`.
-   Upstream's `InvertedCheckbox`, `RadioButton`, `ActiveControlStorageGuard` and
    `GetActiveControlStorageAddress` UI helpers, used only by the excluded UI.

### Existing UI

-   `src/CSEditor/SceneManager/SceneSettingsUI.cpp` is this fork's own editor: the time-of-day period bar with its
    automatic time pause, the interior toggle, the per-feature list, and per-location windows. Weather and
    location pages carry a **Time of Day** toggle that switches the page's saved set. It uses only
    `GetCurrentGameHour` / `SetGameHour`, `GetCurrentPeriod`, `Get*RelevantFeatureNames`,
    `GetFeatureDisplayName`, and the `LocationTarget` accessors.
-   `FeatureListRenderer` draws a feature's `DrawSettings()` inside a baseline `SceneWidgetInterceptor::Scope`
    (`Context::baseline`), so every catalogued control stays editable and edits the feature's base. The
    guard tints each control by the layer winning it: blue for a Scene Manager value, yellow for a feature
    override, green for a sketch. Editing a blue control records a **sketch** (`RecordBaselineEdit`): the
    edited value becomes the base and the resolver holds it in place (`HoldSketchedValues`) until the menu
    stops calling `RetainSketches` for that feature, when the scene value returns. A blue control's gutter
    jumps to the winning page (`FindWinningContext`, `SceneSettingsUI::OpenSceneContext`), which mid-blend
    is the incoming context, or the outgoing one when the incoming context supplies nothing; a sketched one
    commits into it (`CommitSketches`). The feature list shows a blue dot for a feature authored anywhere
    (`HasAnySceneEntriesForFeature`), filled while it applies here, and a green dot while it has sketches.
    **Apply Override** and **Restore Defaults** rewrite the base behind a live scene layer, so the first
    holds a `SceneLayerGuard` and the second follows with `CaptureExternalFeatureChanges`; without either
    the next resolve puts the old values back.
-   `CSEditor` flags a weather that has scene settings via `HasWeatherConfig`.
-   `SceneFeatureReplica::Draw()` replays a feature's real `DrawSettings()` inside a
    `SceneWidgetInterceptor::Scope`, whose ImGui detours bind every control to the scene context, so entry
    authoring needs no per-scene tables: `SceneWidgetBinding::Guard` creates, edits, pauses and deletes
    entries in place. A control that draws a rescaled temporary instead of its settings member declares a
    `ProxyScope` so it still binds.
    `GutterPolicy::GroupMember` is kept although no intercepted feature currently draws a radio group: it is
    what stops several calls against one address (`RadioButton`) from each drawing their own gutter toggle,
    and the alternative to keeping it is a latent double-gutter bug the first time a feature adds one.
-   `src/CSEditor/SceneManager/ScenePageToolbar.cpp` drives the [copy API](#generic-scene-copy-api) and opens
    the preset export dialog (`ScenePresetExport`). `SceneTransitionField` is the one clamped duration field
    shared by the toolbar and the widget gutter.

## Known gaps

-   **Bounds are enforced on apply, not on input.** [Numeric bounds](#numeric-bounds) clamps a value on its
    way into a feature, so nothing out of range reaches a shader constant. A value typed past the range in a
    widget that does not clamp (`clampNumericInput` records which ones) is still stored as typed; only the
    scene layer's own writes are bounded.
-   Presentation metadata that survives into the generated C++ (`sourceWidget`, `hdrColor`,
    `clampNumericInput`) is emitted but unread: the interceptor replays the feature's own widget instead of
    rebuilding one. It stays because `validate_entries` uses it, `sourceWidget` against
    `SOURCE_WIDGET_ENTRY_POINTS` and the other two to enforce colour-metadata invariants.
    `displayPath` / `selectorPath` are read, they name entries.

**Presentation-only concepts do not belong in the generated C++.** `AggregatePresentation`,
`UnifiedEditMode`, choice display names and `GetVirtualAggregateControls` were each generated without a
consumer and have been removed. Consuming any of them would mean the editor synthesizing a widget that does
not exist in the feature's own panel, which breaks the invariant the whole interceptor rests on: a scene
page shows the feature's real `DrawSettings()`, replayed. Do not re-add an emission without a caller that
justifies the second rendering path.

## TODO

-   More UI elements so users can understand which layer is winning, when, and where.
-   A unified preset system with E11.
-   Preset metadata and preset JSONs.
-   Presets are read from a single folder only, and every preset file is loaded at all times.

## Testing

```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_scene_settings_catalog_generator tests.test_scene_settings_policy
```

81 tests. Both suites run in CI via `.github/workflows/pr-python-tests.yaml`, on any PR touching `src/**`,
the generator, or `tests/**`. Run them locally after touching the generator or the policy lists.

The generator can be run standalone to inspect its output:

```bash
python cmake/generate_scene_settings_catalog.py --source-dir . --out-dir /tmp/catalog --min-entries 645 \
    --min-controllable 538 --min-controllable-features 30
```

The generator test file is upstream's with the open-shaders-coupled assertions removed (`CSUtility`,
`PostProcessing`, `LightLimitFix` contact shadows, the `ExtendedTranslucency`/`Upscaling`/`VR` regression
list, and the inverted-display IBL toggles). Do not re-add assertions naming features this fork lacks.
