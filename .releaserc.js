// The branches array is scoped to the branch actually being released rather
// than listing every line at once. Two hard constraints force this:
//
//   1. semantic-release caps `release`-type branches at 3 and globs branch
//      patterns against every branch on origin, so a `hotfix/*` pattern with
//      several live lines throws ERELEASEBRANCHES.
//   2. Giving the pattern a `range` (making it a maintenance branch) instead
//      forces every hotfix line to be strictly older than main's version, so a
//      current-line hotfix resolves to an empty range and dies with
//      EINVALIDNEXTVERSION.
//
// Scoping sidesteps both: one release branch per run, no ordering relative to
// sibling lines. GITHUB_REF_NAME is set for every GitHub Actions step; the
// fallback keeps local `semantic-release --dry-run` runs working.
const refName = process.env.GITHUB_REF_NAME ?? '';
const hotfixLine = /^hotfix\/(\d+\.(?:\d+|x)\.x)$/.exec(refName)?.[1];

// A scoped hotfix branch accepts patch/minor/major, so an unclamped `feat:`
// on hotfix/1.2.x would resolve to 1.3.0 and collide with a version already
// shipped from main. release-hotfix.yaml only cherry-picks fix:/perf:, but
// clamp here as well so a hand-pushed commit can't jump the line.
